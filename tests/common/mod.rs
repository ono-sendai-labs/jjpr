/// CI had no jj for as long as these tests existed. The only tell was runtime.
/// Measured on the `jj_integration` binary: **9 passed in 6.37s** with jj, and
/// **9 passed in 0.00s** without it. Identical pass counts, which is precisely
/// why it went unnoticed.
///
/// Counted rather than estimated: **41** `#[test]` functions across **ten** files
/// gate on this. **31** of them are gated on jj ALONE and are the ones that
/// silently did nothing in CI. The other 10 (in `e2e.rs`, `tty_watch.rs`,
/// `parity.rs`) also sit behind `JJPR_E2E`, which CI does not set, so they skip
/// there regardless of jj and were never part of the hole.
